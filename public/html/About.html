     <p>Dijana Čović is Croatian painter based in Zagreb. Her bold, victorian style - often described as Croatian oil painter, and TV journalist. Television is my work, art is my love. I live in Zagreb and was born in Vukovar. My love for art started  very early, but the war made me turn towards journalism. I have been working 25 years for Croatian National Television, currently as an  editor there. It is hard, and in a moments very tedious work. </p>

     <p>When I first started to make large portrait paintings on canvas years ago, I never thought that in the future I would create so many of them.  I also never thought that I would put them on exhibit as many times as I have, and in so many different places.</p>
