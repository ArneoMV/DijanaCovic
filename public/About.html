          <p id="about_text_2">Born in Vukovar in 1971, she started developing her love for art from her elementary school days when she began to draw frantically and attend her first art drawing workshops. Shortly after high school, her family was forced to seek refuge from war in the Croatian capital Zagreb where she turned to the written word and obtained a university degree in journalism. In 1994, she started her work at Croatian Radiotelevision, where she's currently an editor.</p> 
          <p id="about_text_3">She often finds relief from stress induced by her job and everyday life in painting. She attended two painting workshops, one conducted in the Novi Zagreb Culture Center conducted by Vesna Šantak, an academic painter, and after that a private workshop where she was mentored by a respected academic painter and pedagogue residing in London, Hrvoje Majer.</p>

            <h2>Classical with a dash of conterporary</h2>
            <p>Her painting is compulsive, energetic, and passionate, compositionally colorful, with strong and bold colors, sometimes monochromatic. What is always present in her work is a strong message, sometimes clear, but more often hidden between layers of color. The movements of the brush and spatulas are rhythmic, energetic, and strong like a dance, with thick gestural layers of color. A good part of her artistic opus is a combination of abstraction with realistic scenes. </p>

            <p>Dijana's paintings are alive, perhaps precisely because they are often a reflection of her internal struggle. She likes to paint very expressive portraits of young women, dames from high society in characteristic impressionist poses often with some contemporary surreal detail and a strong message. In her expression, she uses erasing paint with solvents and applies wide traces of oil coating to evoke the realism of figures and portraits and to enhance their expression. Spatulas evoke the abstraction of shapes, lines and enhance the rhythmicity of the image.</p>

              <h2>Refined passion with an aesthetic appeal</h2>
              <p>Her work carries a strong influence of older masters, especially Gustav Klimt, Claude Monet, and Edgar Degas, but there's a dash of inspiration from more contemporary painters such as Kerry J. Marshal, Kehinde Wiley, Mare Light, Jeremy Mann, and Geoffrey Johnson.</p>
              <p>She transforms images of nature into experiences, in which she sees light and possibilities. Decoration and aesthetics are by no means superficial and are of utmost importance to her as she considers them a part of the art of living. When a surrounding is beautiful, it represents means of finding peace and understanding life.</p>
              <p>The background of her paintings is often very transparent, fluid, monochromatic, using a lot of oil, medium and transparent materials. He adds colors to each subsequent layer, to get the effect of distance or depth. He often ends the painting with spatulas, so the paintings have a slightly embossed impression. The surface of the painting is full of life, through layers of colors and textures. The repetition of layers continues until she attains harmony, and that harmony is often hidden in abstract layers.</p>
